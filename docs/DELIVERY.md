# Source delivery — 4 October 2026

The original baseline audit below is retained for history. See [UPDATE_VALIDATION](UPDATE_VALIDATION.md) and [FINAL_SETUP](FINAL_SETUP.md) for the current Drive/calendar update and current test results.

Work was performed in the supplied project folder. PLAN.md retains the original specification; it is a requirements document, not proof all external gates passed.

## Implemented increments

| Phase | Implementation | Evidence/boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Trust and metrics | Canonical adapters, interval union/conflict resolution, owner dates/DST, sleep reconciliation, duration-only history, effective goals, minor-unit ledger, scheduled routines | Fixed-clock fixtures, overlap/overnight browser workflow and recovery tests |
| Sessions and continuity | Node BFF, Postgres/RLS, opaque sessions/CSRF, encrypted Google refresh, record outbox/conflicts, static shares and authenticated AI | Mocked security/provider tests; real database/provider deployment unconfigured |
| Shell | Today/Plan/Capture/Insights/Me, shortcuts, optional modules, themes, local Inter, shared controls/dialogs and redirects | Mobile route checks; optional legacy areas retain older inline styling |
| Daily execution | Editable diaries, capacity/conflicts, approvals/original commitments, timers/leases, check-ins, replan/review, Calendar export and reminder scheduling | Local workflow tests; live Calendar/push still need setup |
| Insights/coach | Shared renderer/charts, date/year ranges, server recomputation, confirmed memory/experiments and pattern guardrails | Domain/context tests; AI cannot execute actions |
| Release foundations | Checksum restore, account isolation, one-writer tab protection, privacy export/removal, explicit PWA updates and operations documentation | Local evidence below; production release gates remain open |

## Verification

Lint completed with zero errors/warnings. The domain/backend suite passed 98 tests covering date/DST/conflict maths, migration/rollback, planning/timers, scoped deduplication, session expiry, cross-owner/CSRF rejection, Google refresh/revocation, sharing, privacy and coaching exclusions. Final results are in validation.json.

Browser workflows cover retained routes, save/reload, 90m against a 4h target (37.5%), approval idempotency, Done with unknown timing, timer pause/reload, reviewed offline capture, meditation confirmation, overlap correction, overnight sleep, actual downloaded backup/restore, tab handover and unsupported Web Locks. Screenshots are in screenshots/.

The performance fixture has 5,000 activities and 1,000 transactions over three years. One desktop run measured daily ~131ms, week ~137ms and year ~1,531ms. See performance.json for machine and method. This is not a phone/Core Web Vitals measurement; large-year computation remains synchronous.

The dependency audit is retained in dependency-audit.json. Five high-severity development findings remain in Tailwind 3's glob chain; npm proposes a breaking Tailwind 4 upgrade. No all-dependency security clearance is claimed.

## Remaining implementation and release boundaries

- Configure Supabase, run both SQL migrations and verify real RLS, multi-device conflict/offline replay, timer takeover and disaster recovery.
- Configure Google OAuth/Calendar and verify real refresh, denial/revocation, partial-export retries and account switching. Automatic free/busy import and adoption of external edits are not implemented. This update removes obsolete unchanged managed blocks on approved re-export.
- Configure VAPID/hosting scheduler; test closed-app push on real Android/iPhone Home Screen installations. In-app pending check-ins and exported Calendar reminders are fallbacks.
- Configure AI provider. Numeric evidence is recomputed on the server, but generated explanations are not mechanically checked numerical claims. Typed executable AI proposals are not provided.
- Live shares, PINs and Drive backup/photo transport are unavailable. Static token snapshots and JSON backup are implemented. Existing public Drive grants require manual review.
- Automatic OCR, native SMS/watch capture and native focus blocking are unavailable. Photos can be manually transcribed; messages/statements use reviewed extraction.
- Money includes ledger/budgets/bills/savings, but advanced variable-spend forecasting, automatic merchant rules and bill reminder digests are not implemented. Manual entry supports INR/USD/EUR/GBP/AUD/CAD; original historical JPY/KRW values are preserved with their units.
- Real-device keyboard/PWA lifecycle checks, full WCAG auditing of every legacy populated state, production monitoring, backups/retention and broader performance testing remain release work.

No actual user/cloud account, Google permissions or deployed resources were deleted or published. Privacy removal tests use isolated mocks/fixtures. Raw original recovery copies may retain old sensitive values by design; active export strips the old configured Gemini key field. Keep recovery copies private and rotate any previously exposed credential at its provider.

Production dependency audit: zero reported vulnerabilities in `production-audit.json`. Final browser groups pass all 11 workflows across the final targeted runs, including both themes, the specified eight core viewport widths, 200% text and keyboard focus restoration. The corrected reflow/recovery/routes group passed 5/5 after fixing the Me layout. These results do not substitute for real-device/background-delivery acceptance.
